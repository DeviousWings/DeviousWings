## 💾 DeviousWings

<h3>I’m a Freelance Web Developer with aspirations in Research and Development for Space Exploration. I’m currently earning my BA in Software Engineering and supplementing my learning with courses from Udemy, freeCodeCamp, and Bottega University’s Coding DevCamp.</h3>

<h3>All my projects—whether personal, freelance, or academic—are published here. Some school projects include pre-written instructions, while my original creations are built from scratch, often inspired by real-world problems I observe. My goal is to turn those problems into smart, elegant digital solutions.</h3>

<summary><h3>👨‍💻 DeviousWings Coding Journey</h3></summary>

I started my journey as the family IT guy. I liked messing with computers—fixing, tweaking, and learning how they worked. Over time, I explored paths like Industrial Engineering and Mechatronics before discovering a passion for creating software. Now, I’m pursuing Software Engineering with an emphasis on Web Development and Machine Learning.

I’ve built tools for personal use, academic projects, and clients, and I’m always seeking ways to use technology to solve real-world problems. My next milestones include publishing a Twitter bot and expanding the Cosmos Library.
