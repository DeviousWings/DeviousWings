<h3>I am a Freelance Web Developer with hopes to be in Research and Development with Space Exploration. I am getting my BA in Software Engineering and taking courses on Udemy, freeCodeCamp, and Bottega University Coding DevCamp. I have a GitHub where all my projects will be posted on. School Projects will have some copy and for the assignment. My projects will be built from the ground up. My projects will be testing my knowledge of certain day-to-day problems I see in the world. </h3>

<summary><h3>👨‍💻DeviousWings Coding Journey</h3></summary>
    I started my journey as the family IT guy. I knew I liked messing with computers, fixing them, tweeking them, and understanding how they worked. I soon starting looking at what I could do in the filed. I went from Industrial Engineering > Mechatronic Engineering > then finally realized I liked being able to create the software. I landed on Software Engineering/Development. I am studying Web Development and Machine Learning. I will soon start publishing my twitter bot.
